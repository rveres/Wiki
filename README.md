# Wiki Web App
Happy Holidays (if you're reading this in 2016)!

This is the source code for my wiki web app built using Google App Engine (Python).

As a developer, I'm obligated to keep my users safe. That's why I've censored some parts of the code (why you'll see '[undisclosed]' in some places).

However, you can access the live, working version of my wiki at: http://wiki-152802.appspot.com/. I'll be continuing to work on it for the forseeable future, so stay tuned for feature updates!

Special thanks to: Steve Huffman for his amazing course that inspired the making of this wiki, Google for their Google App Engine Platform and Material Design, Flickr for the background image

## Changelog:
